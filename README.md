This repository contains code taken from Tensorflow's DCGAN tutorial. The generator model file included here can generate images of "handwritten" digits to varying degrees of accuracy when fed random (ideally normally distributed) numbers in the shape (1, 100). It's not trained to "perfection" - but it's fun to run the plotter script and watch the output. The generated_imgs folder contains some of my personal picks for outputs I thought were nice.
